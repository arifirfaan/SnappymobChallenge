    <p><b>Challenge A</b></p>
    <p>Write a program that will generate four (4) types of printable random objects and
    store them in a single file, each object will be separated by a ",". These are the 4
    objects: alphabetical strings, real numbers, integers, alphanumerics. The
    alphanumerics should contain a random number of spaces before and after it (not
    exceeding 10 spaces). The output should be 10MB in size.</p>

    <br>
    <p><b>Challenge B</b></p>
    <p>
        Create a program that will read the generated file above and print to the console the
    object and its type. Spaces before and after the alphanumeric object must be
    stripped.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Challenge C</b></p>
    <p>
        Dockerize Challenge B. Write a docker file so that it reads the output from Challenge
    A as an Input. Once this container is started, the program in challenge B is executed
    to process this file. The output should be saved in a file and should be exposed to
    the Docker host machine.
